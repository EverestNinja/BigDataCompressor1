# Compression Comparison Chart

This chart compares the compression ratios achieved by different algorithms across various data types.

## Key Findings

- **Time Series Data**: Delta encoding achieves the best compression (78.5%)
- **Text Data**: Huffman coding provides superior compression (53.7%)
- **Categorical Data**: Dictionary encoding shows the highest compression ratio (89.7%)
- **Binary Data (Low Entropy)**: Run-length encoding excels for repetitive binary data (85.4%)
- **Binary Data (High Entropy)**: All algorithms struggle with high-entropy data (< 5% compression)
