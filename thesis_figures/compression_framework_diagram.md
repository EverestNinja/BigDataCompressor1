# Adaptive Compression Framework Diagram

The Adaptive Compression Framework dynamically selects and applies the most appropriate compression algorithm based on data characteristics and system constraints.

## Framework Components

### Data Analyzer
- **Data type detection**: Identifies whether data is text, numerical, time series, categorical, or binary
- **Statistical analysis**: Calculates entropy, run patterns, and value distributions
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies repeating sequences and correlation structures
- **Range analysis**: Determines potential for range-based compression techniques

### Decision Engine
- **Algorithm scoring**: Ranks algorithms based on suitability for detected data characteristics
- **Constraint evaluation**: Considers system requirements like speed vs. compression ratio
- **Bonus scoring**: Awards extra points for specific data characteristics that certain algorithms excel at
- **Final selection**: Chooses the algorithm with the highest overall score

### Compression Manager
- **Algorithm application**: Applies the selected compression algorithm
- **Metadata management**: Stores algorithm choice and parameters with compressed data
- **Format standardization**: Provides consistent interface for all algorithms
- **Error handling**: Detects and manages compression/decompression errors

## Algorithm Selection Process

1. **Data Type Filtering**: Filter algorithms suitable for the detected data type
2. **Constraint Matching**: Score algorithms based on how well they match speed and ratio priorities
3. **Special Characteristics Bonus**: Award bonus points for specific data characteristics:
   - Low entropy → Bonus for Huffman coding
   - Low run ratio → Bonus for RLE
   - High range potential → Bonus for FOR and Delta encoding
   - Time series data → Bonus for Delta-of-Delta
   - Categorical data → Bonus for Dictionary encoding
4. **Final Selection**: Choose the algorithm with the highest total score

## Available Algorithms

| Algorithm | Data Types | Speed Priority | Compression Priority |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Huffman | Text, Binary | Medium | High |
| Delta | Numerical, Time Series | Very High | Medium |
| Delta-of-Delta | Time Series | High | High |
| LZW | Text, Binary, Mixed | Medium | Medium |
| RLE | Binary, Categorical, Text | Very High | Low |
| Dictionary | Categorical, Text | High | High |
| FOR | Numerical, Time Series | High | Medium |

## Data Type Detection

The framework analyzes sample data to identify its type based on characteristics:

- **Text**: String data with character patterns
- **Numerical**: Numbers without strong sequential patterns
- **Time Series**: Sequential numerical data with temporal patterns
- **Categorical**: Data with limited distinct values
- **Binary**: Binary patterns or extremely low-level data
- **Mixed**: Data that combines multiple types
